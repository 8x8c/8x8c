 Objectively, for today,  Rust is god. 
 
 If you are interested in rust encryption apps, save the following html code to your pc and use it for reference.

# Group 3
A focus on high security / very user friendly encryption apps. 


https://github.com/8x8c/xcrypt High security Xchacha20-Poly1305 file encryption for LINUX. 

https://github.com/8x8c/xcrypt_aes High security AES-GCM  file encryption for LINUX. 


https://github.com/8x8c/xcrypt-AES-SIV   High security AES-GCM-SIV  file encryption for LINUX. 



# Group 2 
Very nice no-nonsense encryption apps. Each is only 2 files, cargo.toml and main.rs !! 


https://github.com/8x8c/xchacha A great encryption app made with Rust.

https://github.com/8x8c/AES AES-256-GCM encryption app made with Rust.

https://github.com/8x8c/OTP-elite One Time Pad made with Rust.

https://github.com/8x8c/keygen Awesome Key maker made in Rust.

https://github.com/8x8c/ezAES AES with hard coded key so it runs on ONE command!

https://github.com/8x8c/Feistel-Network-File-Encryption  A basic encryption app


# Group1 
 Archived repos. Lots of imageboards and simple crypto apps. Older stuff, there is some good code in there tho.
