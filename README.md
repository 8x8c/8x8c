https://www.rust-lang.org/  The rust site. 

https://crates.io/   The other rust site. 


 Objectively, for today,  Rust is god. 

 Rust apps in this repo are as simple as possible. 2 files, cargo.toml and main.rs !! Incredibly easy to feed to Ai in order to audit, incredibly easy to modify. The crates.io deps change version numbers, Rust itself gets updates with time. So a ONE SIMPLE main.rs file is easier to update and upgrade in the future. 
 













# Group 4  experimental - Post Quantum Crypto and others






# Group 3

A focus on high security / extremely user friendly encryption apps. NOTE- BECAUSE the apps all use atomic file overwrite, in order to be safe on mac or windows some slight code changes would be required. As such, the apps here are for LINUX. If you are on windows or mac, feed the code to Ai and tell it you are on mac or windows and need atomic file operation updated - or-  use apps from Group 2.

Group 3 has 3 versions of xcrypt - each version is a different algo. 

https://github.com/8x8c/xcrypt-AES-256-GCM-SIV  High security AES-256-GCM-SIV  file encryption for LINUX. 

https://github.com/8x8c/xcrypt-XChaCha20-Poly1305 High security Xchacha20-Poly1305 file encryption for LINUX. 

https://github.com/8x8c/xcrypt_aes High security AES-GCM  file encryption for LINUX. 






# Group 2 
Very nice no-nonsense encryption apps. Each is only 2 files, cargo.toml and main.rs !!

# Group1 
 Archived repos. Lots of imageboards and simple crypto apps. Older stuff, there is some good code in there tho.
